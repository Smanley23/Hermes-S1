 # Initial Backlog Items
1.	Minimize early-stage bugs by keeping the project scope broad. This will allow us to revisit and identify specific areas that need debugging or refinement later.
2.	Integrate various types of vehicles and locations. While this may be complex, maintaining a broad scope initially will help us define more precise parameters in future sprints.
3.	Begin building a functional, user-ready interface. This should go beyond static visuals, a simple, working page will lay the foundation for development.
