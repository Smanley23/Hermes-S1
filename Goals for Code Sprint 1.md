 # Goals for First Code Sprint
1.	Become comfortable using GitHub for collaboration and version control.
2.	Begin developing the user interface for the application.
3.	Implement broad components of the codebase to identify weaknesses and refine them later (following a waterfall-style approach).
4.	Integrate different user capabilities and options to support diverse use cases.
