# Product Vision Hermes 

Our product is an AI interface Program designed to do real-time and adaptive calculations for interstellar navigation. This is an AI service and interface that will be at the helm of most space programs including NASA’s. As of right now most navigational AI is for earthbound systems, like trains or cars. This one will be sophisticated enough for aerospace but also have the capability of earthbound vehicles as well including planes and jets as well as cars and trains. The name of this AI program is Hermes in reference to the Greek God of travel. With it we can usher in a new future of aerospace travel and colonization.
We plan on using market research and scientific research. What better way to advertise a product than necessity.
As critical parts of our infrastructure become increasingly digitized and integrated with AI, we at Hermes are committed to harnessing the positive potential of artificial intelligence to enhance safety and innovation. With a rise in serious air traffic incidents in recent years, we aim to reduce the margin for human error through rigorous testing and the implementation of advanced AI algorithms.
What once seemed like science fiction is now within reach. Our cutting-edge systems not only make everyday air travel safer, but also pave the way for future planetary exploration.
While the idea of integrating AI into aviation and spaceflight may sound ambitious, rest assured that the foundation of our machine learning technology has been carefully curated and developed by some of the world’s top aerospace and space engineers. Their expertise, combined with our state-of-the-art AI capabilities, positions Hermes years ahead of the curve.
Thanks to our advanced AI capabilities, this product is an ideal solution for any aviation or spaceflight organization that chooses to adopt it. We believe this service will soon set the standard in both everyday air travel and future interstellar missions.
At Hermes, safety is our top priority. We’re building a culture rooted in security, innovation, and the empowerment of bright, young minds. We are proud to be “keeping the future present.”
