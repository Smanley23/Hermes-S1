# (Sprint 1 Review and Questions)

What went well this sprint?
GitHub proved to be extremely helpful and effective not only for sharing code snippets, but also for exchanging files and project information. It helped streamline our collaboration and improve communication across the team.

What did not go well this sprint?
We encountered and expect to continue facing some challenges with the AI platform. Most of our current progress has been focused on the external parts of the service, such as the user interface and other input features.

Did you complete the tasks you planned to complete?
We made a lot of solid progress on our project this week, and I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished. Setting challenging goals is important, and I believe we performed well. It’s also valuable to recognize all successes, no matter how small.

Did you experience any unforeseen technical issues that prevented your progress?
Getting started with GitHub was a bit difficult at first, as I wasn’t familiar with it. However, once I learned how to use it, I realized how useful it could be for our workflow.

Do you feel you are on track to complete your project?
Yes, I believe we are making strong strides. We did come to the realization that building a fully operational AI supercomputer was beyond our current scope and experience. As a result, we shifted our focus toward developing a strong interface capable of representing and interacting with advanced hardware we don’t currently have access to.
Once we made this adjustment, our goals became much more achievable.

What are the goals for the upcoming sprint?
For the second sprint, I hope to write more lines of functional code and begin implementing the advanced UI. We have a clear vision of how the application should look, behave, and respond. Now, it's time to start bringing everything together. I believe the next sprint will be smoother and more productive.
